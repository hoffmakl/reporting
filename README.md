# Examples of Code for Reporting Analyses in Rmarkdown

Example 1:
Assemble a function which returns Rmarkdown-friendly output including headers for organization. 
Useful if you have multiple outcomes/explanatory variables/data sets that you want to report identical analyses on.

[Example 1 code](headerFuns.Rmd), when knitted, compiles an html report with headers and subheaders for two identical sample analyses.

[Here](vg.R) is an example of using David Gohel's officer and rvg packages to export your plots as editable objects in powerpoint.
